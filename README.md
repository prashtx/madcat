# madcat
Like cat, but with markdown->ansi conversion.

Hate typing `cat README.md` and seeing gross formatting instead of nice(ish) text? No? Well, ok.

## Installation
```
npm install madcat -g
```

## Usage
```
madcat README.md
```

or

```
cat README.md | madcat
```

or

```
cat README.md | madcat -
```
